				<p>Project 1 was 14 variations, first I thought of 100 questions to try and find a common theme
                    of what I wanted to explore. I ended up picking dreams as my theme. I wanted to do something in the style of indie games like
                    Squirrel Stapler (2023) and Fishing Vacation (2022) so I thought I should try and collage the pieces 
                    to give them a more 3D, grungey feel. Once I'd decided on what kind of vibe I wanted I made a list of around 20
                    scenes from dreams that fit what I was trying to do. Then I made some sketches so I could figure out what kinds of compositions
                    I wanted.

                </table>
                <p>After this I started collaging things together and made these.</p>

                <table class = "table">
                    <tr>
                        <td class="text-center" scope = "col"><img width="200px" src="./project1/IMG_4570.png"></td>

                        <td class="text-center" scope = "col"><img width="200px" src="./project1/IMG_4586.PNG"></td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td class="text-center" scope = "col"><img width="200px" src="./project1/IMG_4583.png"></td>

                    </tr>
                </table>

                <p>At this point I wasn't too sure about the collages I was doing. I went in a few different directions after this. First,
                    I thought that I should use an image for only the background and focus more on the figures in the drawing. That ended 
                    up looking kind of strange so then I decided to not use any collaging or identifiable figures and just draw the colors
                    and how the dream felt (in this case the dream had an overwhelming presence of metal disk, so I tried to draw the metal 
                    disk). That one was interesting but it wasn't a very sustainable idea because any other item-drawing attempt I made was
                    repetitive. Then I finally decided to just draw what the dream looked like and not worry about trying to make it look 3D
                    or pull feelings from it. These drawings were of fairly neutral scenes from dreams where I wasn't really sure what was happening,
                    and during the dream what I was feeling didn't match what was going on.

                <p>This was an interesting experiment, and if I were to do it again I would stay away from collaging and focus more on 
                    drawing interesting scenes from my dreams.

                    drawing with the alien/monster (called "Father" in the dream) I was very inspired by the color grading used in the first
                    Twilight movie, as well as other creative choices she made in terms of mood.

                    I really like some of the more abstract work by Francis Bacon, if I had done another successful item-drawing it probably would
                    have more closely mimiced his style and more limited use of red.

                    The unconcious mind is something I've been interested for a while, as someone who dreams a lot I can tell that my dreams
                    affect my overall creativity and I try to pay close attention to my dreams and write something down when I wake up.

                    Another artist that really inspires me is Salvador Dali and his really bizarre paintings, my dreams aren't as crazy as his probably
                    were, but I aim for that level of intrigue and confusion.
