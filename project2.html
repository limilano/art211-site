				<p>Initally for project 2 I was thinking of doing another dream but in a longer format. I was going to draw everything
                    that I used in the video but during one of the first discussions we talked about only using found footage/images 
                    so I tried to do the same thing but with pictures.

                  </video>

                    <source src="./project2/MilanoLillian_art211_clip2_river.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                  </video>

                  <p>After this we discussed as a class having a more limited source of footage and the loose theme of 
                    death in the digital age. My first video was kind of inspired by black box footage being shared on tv and online, and my second one 
                    was a play on LiveLeak which was a website where gore videos and military videos were shared in the 2010's. I thought it 
                    would be funny to edit together some dinosaur fighting/death clips like a prehistoric LiveLeak video.

                  </video>

                  <p>I don't think I really had a strong idea for either of these pieces, I don't have a lot of experience with found footage 
                    so it was interesting to work with and find cool things to clip.

                    I really liked the high-contrast and flickering in his works, so I tried to mimic it a little bit without making it 
                    too hard to see what was going on.

                    I used this tutorial on the first 2 videos to try and create a more constant vintage effect across all the photos.
